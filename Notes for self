General Plan
Series of puzzle rooms

Basic premise:
Limited number of "Charges"
Use "Charges" to activate magical effects to solve puzzles.

Possible effets: 
"Freeze" blocks of ice for platforming
"Grow" vines to climb up

Moss to prevent fall damage?
Wind to launch across gaps?
Move branches/roots to allow access to other areas (open door)

Reclaiming a "Charge" undoes the effect it was used to activate (ice block melts, vines return to soil, etc)
Increase in number of charges each level alonside new effects.
Effects shown by coloured particle effects.
Visual design to be forest area.

Reclaim charge: most recent one first? oldest? allow for specific ones to be deactivated?
--Trying to use charge on already charged effect reclaims charge?-coupled with button press to reclaim all charges at once?--
